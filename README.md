## Huion-Switch-Screen
AHK script to toggle pen mapping across different monitors.

This script is designed for buttonless Huion pen tablets, such as the Kamvas 22 Plus, and introduces the functionality to switch pen mapping using a hotkey.
The Huion driver lacks this crucial functionality. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The script works similarly to a game hack, as it injects an integer value directly into the memory of a running process, in this case, HuionTabletCore.exe.
I used cheat engine https://www.cheatengine.org/ to find the memorypointers and offsets to set the value.

Since this is a AutoHotKey script you can easily change it for yourself and use a different hotkey or make one hotkey for each monitor or whatever you like :) 

##### Installation:

- download both huionhack.ahk and classmemory.ahk and put them in the same folder, then run huionhack.ahk
- or download the precompiled exe from the release section and use that instead 
- If you want to autostart eleveated apps at windows startup i highly recommend to use the tool "skip UAC Prompt" https://www.sordum.org/16219/skip-uac-prompt-v1-2/
