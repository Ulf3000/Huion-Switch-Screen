# Huion-Switch-Screen
ahk script hack to toggle the pen mapping through the different monitors.

I used cheat engine to find the pointers and offsets to set which monitor the pen maps to.
This ahk script writes to the huion drivers memory and provides "Switch Screen" to Huion Models like my Kamvas 22 Plus , which dont have any buttons.
(Huions driver is missing that feature)

Since this is a AHK script you can easily change it for yourself and use different hotkeys or make one hotkey for each monitor or whatever you like :) 


THE MEMORY ADRESS POINTERS and OFFSETS are for the driver version 15.4.1.354  .. its probably wont work on other driver versions, but its easy to find the pointers and offsets with cheat engine
